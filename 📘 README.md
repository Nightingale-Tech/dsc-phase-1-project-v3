📘 README.d
This Jupyter Notebook (student.ipynb) explores and analyzes aviation accident data to uncover trends and generate business insights. It uses Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset.

🎯 Project Objectives
Load and explore aviation accident data from the FAA.

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Generate visual insights through charts and graphs.

Provide three business recommendations based on findings.

📁 Files Included
student.ipynb — the main analysis notebook.

Aviation_Data.csv — raw data used for analysis.

Aviation_Accident_Charts_Presentation.pptx — sample presentation slides with visualizations.

README.md — this documentation file.

🧰 Tools and Libraries
Python 3.x

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Visualizations
Bar chart: Top 10 Phases of Flight for Accidents

Pie chart: Distribution of Injury Severity

Histogram: Fatal Injuries per Broad Phase of Flight

📊 Business Recommendations
Increase pilot training focus during approach and landing, where most incidents occur.

Improve maintenance protocols for aircraft types frequently involved in severe accidents.

Allocate more safety resources to locations with high accident frequency.

✅ How to Run
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed (or use Anaconda).

Place student.ipynb and Aviation_Data.csv in the same folder.

Open the notebook and run the cells in order.

📌 Notes
The data was cleaned by dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and renaming headers for clarity.

You can customize visuals or recommendations further depending on business needs.
